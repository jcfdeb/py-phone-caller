# Not ready to be used in easily way...

A Web Interface for the 'py-phone-caller' was added.

**Current Status**: works fine, but several things need to be improved or implemeted

#### What's does this?

Maybe [this](https://github.com/jcfdeb/py-phone-caller/blob/main/doc/fedora34-server-with-podman_though-ansible.md) can help to explain what this code does. 


#### Good Adveices

* The project isn't ready to be used without a deep knowledge of Asterisk, Linux, etc.
* Is not ready to be used in production
* Have patience, maybe in a near future it will be more _usable_
